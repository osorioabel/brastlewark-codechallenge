# Brastlewark - Code challenge

# Why I use.....

#### As requested here is a list of the libraries I used on the demo and why

* **RxSwift/RxCocoa**: Simplify the async tasks and provide several extension to make responsive UIs 

* **RxDataSources:** With this library we can conform UITableView and UICollectionView delegates and datasources protocols less tedious. There is a large number of delegate methods that need to be implemented for the simplest case possible.

* **Moya o Moya/RxSwift:** Networking layer abstraction and great companion for combine Rx and Alamofire (which is a dependency of Moya)

* **Gloss:** Simple to use provide simple API to decode and encode models.

* **Localize-Swift:** Good library to manage localizable strings and great support for i18n convention 

* **TextAttributes:** Swifty way to compose attributed strings

* **SnapKit:** Swifty way to make UIConstraints in code

* **CellRegistrable:** Useful extension to register UITableViewCell or UICollectionCell when we are not using Storyboards

* **MRProgress:** One of many Loading HUB around the iOS community

* **SwiftyUserDefaults:** Swifty way to manage,store,retreive data from NSDefaults

# Hidden features 
#### As is probable to miss features on this demo app, here a list of them:

* Change Language: The app supports Spanish and English.

* Zoomable ImageView: Every UIImageView had a pinch gesture to zoom in and zoom out like Instagram does
